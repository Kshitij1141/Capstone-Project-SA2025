##  Overview

Urban parking is a scarce and often mismanaged resource. 
Fixed pricing models frequently cause overcrowding in 
high-demand zones and underuse in others. 
Our solution introduces a real-time, data-driven **dynamic 
pricing engine** across 14 city parking lots. By 
leveraging **machine learning** and **economic principles,** the 
system intelligently adjusts prices based on fluctuating 
demand, environmental context, and competitor behavior 
All implementations are built from scratch using  
**NumPy,** **Pandas,** and **Pathway.**
